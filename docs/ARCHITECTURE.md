# Architecture

The decisions are in [`adr/`](adr); this file describes what exists in the code today and grows
with each phase.

## Layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `brand/` | Logo files as supplied. Imported directly; never copied, redrawn or re-traced |
| `src/app/` | Next.js App Router pages |
| `src/theme/` | Design tokens. The only place raw colour values may appear |
| `src/messages/` | Message catalogs. The only place user-facing text may appear |
| `src/platform/` | Product-level constants |
| `eslint-rules/` | Lint rules that enforce the two lines above, plus logical (right-to-left safe) CSS |
| `supabase/migrations/` | Timestamped, additive, re-runnable SQL |
| `supabase/schema.sql` | Generated mirror of the migrations (`npm run schema:build`) |
| `supabase/tests/` | Test-only shim that makes plain Postgres resemble a Supabase project |
| `tests/unit`, `tests/db`, `tests/e2e` | Vitest, database gate, Playwright |

## Gates

`npm run verify` runs lint, type-check, unit tests, the schema mirror check, the secret check and
the build. `npm run test:db` installs the migrations on a scratch Postgres fresh, re-runs them, runs
`schema.sql` on top, then runs the tenant-safety tests. `npm run test:e2e` runs Playwright against
the production build. CI runs all three on every push and pull request.

## Guards in place from the first commit

- A raw colour, palette class, pixel radius, physical direction class or literal UI string in a
  component fails lint.
- English and Spanish catalogs must have the same keys and placeholders.
- Every token text/background pair of the default preset must reach 4.5:1.
- Every table in `public` must have forced row-level security, a `tenant_id` (unless allow-listed
  as global), at least one policy, no policy that is simply `true`, and no grant to `anon`.
- A new table gets no privileges for signed-out visitors by default.
- No `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variable may look like a secret, and no client component may read a server
  variable.
